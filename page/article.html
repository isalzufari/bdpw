        <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written
          in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be
          rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
          specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously,
          which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
          CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.
        </p>

        <p>
          After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS
          modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
          separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of
          the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version
          numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.

          CSS first steps
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color,
          size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
          features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it
          works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS building blocks
          This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and
          its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at
          the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and
          borders, debugging, and lots more.

          The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
          essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS styling text
          With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text —
          one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting
          font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the
          module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS layout
          At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the
          boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in
          relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive
          deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and
          positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
